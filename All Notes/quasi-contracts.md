A quasi-contract is an extra-contractual obligation that refers to certain lawful, voluntary, and unilateral acts that give rise to a juridical relation to the end that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another. There are two categories of quasi-contracts defined under the Civil Code (Title XVII Chapter 1 of RA 386), namely: *Negotiorum Gestio* and *Solutio Indebiti*.

## Negotiorum Gestio
A Negotiorum gestio, which is latin for “management of business”, is a form of spontaneous voluntary agency acts on behalf and for the benefit of a property without the consent of its owner. A negotiorum gestio may only arise upon the satisfaction of these conditions:

1. When the property or business is not neglected or abandoned; or
2. If the officious manager has been tacitly authorized by the owner

There are two parties in a negotiorum gestio, namely:

1. The owner; and
2. The officious manager

The **officious manager** refers to the individual or a party (solidarily) that takes agency of a business or property on behalf of the owner. They shall perform their duties with the diligence of a good father of a family, pay for damages that may be suffered by the owner as a result of their fault or negligence, and assume liability for fortuitous events. Any contracts entered by the officious manager shall be personally liable for contracts he has entered during his tenure as the same.

The **owner** shall reimburse the officious manager for necessary and useful expenses as a result of such agency, and for all the damages that may have suffered by the officious manager in the performance of their duties; *provided*, that the officious manager has acted in good faith and that the property is intact, ready to be returned to the owner.

A negotiorum gestio is extinguished when the owner puts an end to such; or when the officious manager withdraws from the management; or if the owner or the officious manager suffers death, civil interdiction, insanity, or insolvency.

## Solutio Indebiti
A solutio indebiti refers to *payment by mistake*. It gives rise to an obligation to return a thing delivered through mistake.

## Other quasi-contracts
There are also other quasi-contracts under the provision of the Civil Code. However, it still follows the principle that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another.

Quasi-contracts often result from mistakes (made in good faith) committed by a person towards another. [[quasi-delicts|Quasi-delicts]], on the other hand, often result from fault or negligence committed by a person towards another.
