The Commission on Appointments is a constitutional body vested with confirmatory power to approve or reject nominees which shall be referred to them by the President.

Certain nominees of the President and those that are expressly provided by law are required to undergo the confirmation of the Commission on Appointments.

Currently, the following officials require the confirmation of the Commission on Appointments:
1. The Heads of the Executive Departments
2. Ambassadors and other Public Ministers and Consults
3. High Ranking Officers of the Armed Forces from the rank of Colonel or Naval Captain
4. Regular Members of the [[Judicial and Bar Council]]
5. Chairman and Commissioners of the [[Constitutional Commissions]].

The Commission on Appointments is composed of the Senate President as the *ex officio* Chairperson, twelve Senators, and twelve Representatives from the House of Representatives. They are elected based on a proportional representation of the political parties and parties or organizations under the party-list system represented.

The Senate President only casts their vote in cases of tie.
