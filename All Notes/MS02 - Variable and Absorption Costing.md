- Variable vs Absorption Costing
	- Absorption costing refers to the profit and loss statement format presented to external users. Meanwhile, variable costing refers to the P&L statement format primarily used for internal users.
	- Absorption Costing P&L Format → total sales - cost of sales - expenses
	- Variable Costing, otherwise known as **contribution margin format**, fosters profitability analysis.
	- **Throughput Costing**, or *Super Variable Costing*, has ==raw materials== as product costs, and the rest, as period costs.
	- **Super Absorption Costing** all manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs are product costs, for as long as they add value to the product.
- Distinction between product and period costs
	- Product costs → inventoried when incurred, charged only when sold
	- Period costs → treated as an outright expense the moment it is incurred
- Inventory costs between variable and absorption costing
	- Treatment of Operating Costs: ==See Table 1==
	- Net operating income and inventory levels: ==See Table 2==
	- Cost Segregation
		- VC → costs according to behaviour (internal reporting only)
		- AC → costs according to function (external reporting)
			- Note: income statement according to function is the same as this. However, income statement according to nature is different from income statement based on VC (or by behaviour)
	- Presentation of Income Statement
		- VC → contribution margin income approach
		- AC → conventional income statement (i.e., according to function)
			- Issues:
				- Managers may seek to manipulate income by producing too many units
				- Deciding to manufacture products that absorb the highest amount of fixed costs, regardless of demand
				- Accepting an order to increase production, even through another plant in the same firm is better suited to handle that order
				- Deferring maintenance
			- Reduce undesirable effects:
				- Focus on careful budgeting and inventory planning to reduce management’s freedom to build up excess inventory.
				- Incorporate a *carrying charge* for inventory in the internal accounting system.
				- Change the period to evaluate performance. Instead of quarterly or annual horizon, evaluate the manager over a three-to-five year period.
				- Include nonfinancial as well as financial variables in the measures of performance evaluation.
		- SVC → throughput contribution income statement
		- ==ENDPOINT==
- Nature and treatment of fixed factory overhead costs
- Reconciliation of operating income under variable and absorption costing

	- Costing Methods

		- SVC → super variable costing, or throughput costing
		- SAC → super absorption costing
	- Cost Treatment
		- X → period costs
		- O → product costs

| Costs                       | VC  | AC  | SVC | SAC |
| --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct materials            | O   | O   | O   | O   |
| Direct labour (variable)    | O   | O   | X   | O   |
| Factory overhead (variable) | O   | O   | X   | O   |
| Factory overhead (fixed)    | X   | O   | X   | O   |
| S&A expense (variable)      | X   | X   | X   | O*  |
| S&A expense (fixed)         | X   | X   | X   | O*  |
*Note: for Selling and Administrative Expenses, under ==SAC==, it is treated as a product cost only if such expenses adds value to the product*

| Production and Sales | Net Income | Inventories |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| P = S                | AC = VC    | BE = BB     |
| P > S                | AC > VC    | BE > BB     |
| P < S                | AC < VC    | BE < BB     |
*Note: BE means Balance Ending; BB means Balance Beginning*
