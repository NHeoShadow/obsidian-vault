- Variable vs Absorption Costing
	- Absorption costing refers to the profit and loss statement format presented to external users. Meanwhile, variable costing refers to the P&L statement format primarily used for internal users.
	- Absorption Costing P&L Format → total sales - cost of sales - expenses
	- Variable Costing, otherwise known as **contribution margin format**, fosters profitability analysis.
	- **Throughput Costing**, or *Super Variable Costing*, has ==raw materials== as product costs, and the rest, as period costs.
	- **Super Absorption Costing** all manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs are product costs, for as long as they add value to the product.
- Distinction between product and period costs
	- Product costs → inventoried when incurred, charged only when sold
	- Period costs → treated as an outright expense the moment it is incurred
- Inventory costs between variable and absorption costing
	- See Table 1
- Nature and treatment of fixed factory overhead costs
- Reconciliation of operating income under variable and absorption costing
