- Variable vs Absorption Costing
	- Absorption costing refers to the profit and loss statement format presented to external users. Meanwhile, variable costing refers to the P&L statement format primarily used for internal users.
	- Absorption Costing P&L Format → total sales - cost of sales - expenses
	- Variable Costing, otherwise known as **contribution margin format**, fosters profitability analysis.
	- **Throughput Costing**, or *Super Variable Costing*, has ==raw materials== as product costs, and the rest, as period costs.
	- **Super Absorption Costing** all manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs are product costs, for as long as they add value to the product.
- Distinction between product and period costs
	- Product costs → inventoried when incurred, charged only when sold
	- Period costs → treated as an outright expense the moment it is incurred
- Inventory costs between variable and absorption costing
	- Treatment of Operating Costs: ==See Table 1==
	- Net operating income and inventory levels: ==See Table 2==
	- Cost Segregation
		- VC → costs according to behaviour
		- AC → costs according to function
	- Presentation of Income Statement
- Nature and treatment of fixed factory overhead costs
- Reconciliation of operating income under variable and absorption costing

	- Costing Methods
		- VC → variable costing

		- SAC → super absorption costing
	- Cost Treatment
		- X → period costs
		- O → product costs


| Costs                       | VC  | AC  | SVC | SAC |
| --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct materials            | O   | O   | O   | O   |
| Direct labour (variable)    | O   | O   | X   | O   |
| Factory overhead (variable) | O   | O   | X   | O   |
| Factory overhead (fixed)    | X   | O   | X   | O   |
| S&A expense (variable)      | X   | X   | X   | O*  |
| S&A expense (fixed)         | X   | X   | X   | O*  |
*Note: for Selling and Administrative Expenses, under ==SAC==, it is treated as a product cost only if such expenses adds value to the product*


Table 2: net operating income and inventory levels

| Production and Sales | Net Income | Inventories |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| P = S                | AC = VC    | BE = BB     |
| P > S                | AC > VC    | BE > BB     |
| P < S                | AC < VC    | BE < BB     |
*Note: BE means Balance Ending; BB means Balance Beginning*
