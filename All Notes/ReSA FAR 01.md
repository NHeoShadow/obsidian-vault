- **Accounting for Inventories**
	- When to consider something as "inventory"
		- Held for sale in the ordinary course of business
		- In process of production for such sale
		- Materials and supplies to be consumed in production process
		- Note: for as long as it is intended to be sold at another date, or if will be used as a material to sell something, then it is considered as inventory
	- Initial Recognition of Inventory shall be at **cost**
		- Cost of inventory is composed of the following:
			- Purchase price (net)
				- Net of trade discounts, rebates, and similar items
			- Import duties (*non-refundable* tax)
			- Transport cost (freight in)
			- Handling Cost
			- Other costs attributable to inventory
				- Otherwise known as directly attributable costs (DACs)
					- Overhead costs
					- Designing specified by customer
					- Borrowing cost
	- Ownership of Inventory
		- For goods in transit (sale or purchase)
			- See Matrix Table 1 below
			- For FOB Shipping Point, ownership of inventory is transferred to buyer upon actual shipment.
				- Freight in -> capitalized
			- For FOB Destination Point, ownership of inventory is transferred to buyer upon receipt of goods
				- Freight out -> selling expense
			- Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) ownership is transferred to buyer upon actual shipment
			- For Free Alongside Ship, transfer of ownership usually occurs in between
			- If the problem is silent, it is a good in transit
		- Goods out on consignment
			- Consignee is in possession, the consignor still owns the goods
			- The unsold inventory shall comprise the inventory for goods on consignment
			- Composition:
				- Cost of goods
				- Freight
				- Capitalized cost
			- Selling price of goods -> cost
				- Conversion is based on how markup is added
				- If based on sales:
					- Selling Price * (100% - Gross Profit %)
				- If based on cost
					- Selling Price / (100% + Gross Profit %)
		- Credit Card Sales
			- Under PFRS15, if inventories is sold through credit cards, it is recognized upon sale because the performance obligation is already satisfied.
			- **Ownership is already on buyer**. The amount due by the buyer is settled by the credit card company.
		- Instalment Sales
			- Reasonable assured (silent) - ownership is on buyer
			- Not reasonable assured - ownership is on seller
		- Lay Away Sales
		- Customer Acceptance
			- A product that is manufactured for a particular customer with particular specifications, this is a special order and is considered to be *sold upon completion* (i.e., tailored-fit)
		- Sale with right of return
			- PFRS15: There is already a delivery of goods. Therefore, there is already a transfer of ownership.
			- General rule for sales with right of return, ownership is already on buyer
			- Revenue shall not be expected for those expected to be returned
			- For amounts expected to be returned, do not recognize the portion that is expected to be returned.
			- For the portion expected not to be returned, recognize as revenue already.
		- Sale on Trial or Approval (ex.: AVON, beauty products)
			- The customer is not yet committed to pay until the trial period lapses
			- Control is not yet transferred to the customer until the trial period lapses or if the customer agrees to purchase such goods.
			- General rule: the seller is the owner
			- Customer acceptance: buyer is owner
			- Trial period lapses: buyer is owner
				- This is considered to be sold already
		- Bill and Hold Sales/Agreements
			- Buyer is owner of goods
		- Repurchase agreement
			- otherwise known as *buyback agreement*
			- goods are used for collateral
			- Ownership is owned by seller
		- Ownership is important to ensure that the amounts reported as inventory in the Statement of Financial Position is correct.
