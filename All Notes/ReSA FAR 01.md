- **Accounting for Inventories**
	- When to consider something as "inventory"
		- Held for sale in the ordinary course of business
		- In process of production for such sale
		- Materials and supplies to be consumed in production process
		- Note: for as long as it is intended to be sold at another date, or if will be used as a material to sell something, then it is considered as inventory
	- Initial Recognition of Inventory shall be at **cost**
		- Cost of inventory is composed of the following:
			- Purchase price (net)
				- Net of trade discounts, rebates, and similar items
			- Import duties (*non-refundable* tax)
			- Transport cost (freight in)
			- Handling Cost
			- Other costs attributable to inventory
				- Otherwise known as directly attributable costs (DACs)
					- Overhead costs
					- Designing specified by customer
					- Borrowing cost
	- Ownership of Inventory
		- For goods in transit (sale or purchase)
			- See Matrix Table 1 below
			- For FOB Shipping Point, ownership of inventory is transferred to buyer upon actual shipment.
				- Freight in -> capitalized
