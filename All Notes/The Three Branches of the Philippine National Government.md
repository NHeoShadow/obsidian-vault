In the Philippine National Government, especially to that created by virtue of The [1987 Philippine Constitution](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/), there are three Branches of the Philippine National Government, namely the Executive Department, the Legislative Department, and the Judiciary Department.

### Executive Department
The Executive Department is responsible for the execution of all laws created by the Congress. In the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the President is the Head of the Executive Department.

The Executive Department is also composed of the Cabinet of the Philippines, or the *Gabinete ng Pilipinas*. 

The Vice President acts as a *spare tire* in case of resignation or removal of the President. However, the Vice President may also conduct its own operations for they are vested with their own office.

Certain positions within the Executive Department require the confirmation of the [[Commission on Appointments]], a constitutional body vested with confirmatory power for all nominations which shall be made by the President prior to their appointment.

### Legislative Department
The Legislative Department is responsible for the creation of pieces of legislation for the Government of the Philippines. It is composed of two House of Congress, namely the Senate and the House of Representatives.
