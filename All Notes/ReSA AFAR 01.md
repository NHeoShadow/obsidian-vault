- Cost Accounting
	- Refers to recording, classifying, and reporting all costs aspects of company performance during a particular period of time.
	- It is a system that records, summarizes, analyses, and interprets the details of the cost of materials, labour, and overhead necessary to produce and sell an article or product.
	- Also see: [[MS-A - Overview of Management Services#Introduction to Management Accounting]]
	- Basic classification of costs:
		- Product Costs - applies to sold and unsold units
			- Sold units → cost of goods sold
			- Unsold units → capitalizable unsold inventory (ending)
			- Different types of manufacturing costs:
				- Direct Materials Used (DMU)
					- It is a Direct Material if it is a significant material used in producing a product.
					- For insignificant or immaterial materials, such as screws, they are called as *Indirect materials*
				- Direct Labour (DL)
					- Labour Work Force *directly* involved in the manufacturing process
				- Manufacturing Overhead (MOH)
					- Costs incurred other than Direct Materials Used and Direct Labour
					- Essentially, a *miscellaneous* item. Examples include:
						- Indirect Materials Used
						- Indirect Labour
						- Rent of Factory
						- Depreciation of Manufacturing Equipment
			- Direct Costs → visible costs, and is composed of DMU and DL
			- Indirect Cost → not visible costs, and is composed of MOH
			- Prime Costs → primary ingredients to convert raw materials to final product. Composed of DMU and DL
			- Conversion Costs → used to convert raw materials into final products. Composed of DL and MOH
			- Total Manufacturing Costs (TMC) → DMU + DL + MOH
			- Cost Flow, in this particular order:
				- TMC → WIP → FG → COGS
		- Period Costs - applies to sold units (operating expenses)
			- Different types of period costs:
				- Distribution/selling expenses → freight out, gasoline and oil, delivery truck repairs, delivery workers’ salaries, advertising and salesperson’s salaries
				- Administrative expenses → office supplies, rent of office, & depreciation of non-manufacturing equipment
	- Cost Accumulation Procedures
		- Job Order Costing
			- Uses products that are manufactured *within* a department, or cost centre that are **heterogeneous** or **dissimilar**.
			- These products are manufactured *individually* or in *distinct lots* or batches; each job requires different amounts of materials, labour, and overhead.
			- Accumulates costs applicable to each specified job order or lot of similar goods manufactured on a specific order for stock or for a customer.
			- Job is assigned a number and a form called the **job cost sheet**.
			- When completed, job cost sheet shows the *total costs* for the completed job.
			- Job cost per unit may then be obtained by dividing the total cost of the job by the number of units completed.
		- Process Costing
		- Hybrid/Operation Costing (or Blended Method)
			- Uses job order and process costing at the same time
		- Backflush Costing
			- Complements Just-in-Time (JIT)
	- Cost Accumulation System (see Table 1 below)
		- Actual Costing System → DM, DL, and FOH are recorded in actual amount.
			- However, the problem is that the expenses incurred in FOH are often delayed, or its actual expenses cannot be reasonably provided in time. Hence, the normal costing system was developed.
			- [ ] Further research: why was the *normal costing system* developed
		- Normal Costing System → DM and DL are recorded in actual amount. FOH is in applied amount.
