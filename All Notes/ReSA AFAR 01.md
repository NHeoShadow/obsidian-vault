- Cost Accounting
	- Refers to recording, classifying, and reporting all costs aspects of company performance during a particular period of time.
	- It is a system that records, summarizes, analyses, and interprets the details of the cost of materials, labour, and overhead necessary to produce and sell an article or product.
	- Also see: [[MS-A - Overview of Management Services#Introduction to Management Accounting]]
	- Basic classification of costs:
		- Product Costs - applies to sold and unsold units
			- Sold units → cost of goods sold
			- Unsold units → capitalizable unsold inventory (ending)
			- Different types of manufacturing costs:
				- Direct Materials Used (DMU)
					- It is a Direct Material if it is a significant material used in producing a product.
					- For insignificant or immaterial materials, such as screws, they are called as *Indirect materials*
				- Direct Labour (DL)
					- Labour Work Force *directly* involved in the manufacturing process
				- Manufacturing Overhead (MOH)
					- Costs incurred other than Direct Materials Used and Direct Labour
					- Essentially, a *miscellaneous* item. Examples include:
						- Indirect Materials Used
						- Indirect Labour
						- Rent of Factory
						- Depreciation of Manufacturing Equipment
			- Direct Costs → visible costs, and is composed of DMU and DL
			- Indirect Cost → not visible costs, and is composed of MOH
			- Prime Costs → primary ingredients to convert raw materials to final product. Composed of DMU and DL
			- Conversion Costs → used to convert raw materials into final products. Composed of DL and MOH
			- Total Manufacturing Costs (TMC) → DMU + DL + MOH
			- Cost Flow, in this particular order:
				- TMC → WIP → FG → COGS
		- Period Costs - applies to sold units (operating expenses)
			- Different types of period costs:
				- Distribution/selling expenses → freight out, gasoline and oil, delivery truck repairs, delivery workers’ salaries, advertising and salesperson’s salaries
				- Administrative expenses → office supplies, rent of office, & depreciation of non-manufacturing equipment
	- Cost Accumulation Procedures
		- Job Order Costing
			- Uses products that are manufactured *within* a department, or cost centre that are **heterogeneous** or **dissimilar**.
			- These products are manufactured *individually* or in *distinct lots* or batches; each job requires different amounts of materials, labour, and overhead.
			- Accumulates costs applicable to each specified job order or lot of similar goods manufactured on a specific order for stock or for a customer.
			- Job is assigned a number and a form called the **job cost sheet**.
			- When completed, job cost sheet shows the *total costs* for the completed job.
			- Job cost per unit may then be obtained by dividing the total cost of the job by the number of units completed.
		- Process Costing
		- Hybrid/Operation Costing (or Blended Method)
			- Uses job order and process costing at the same time
		- Backflush Costing
			- Complements Just-in-Time (JIT)
	- Cost Accumulation System (see Table 1 below)
		- Actual Costing System → DM, DL, and FOH are recorded in actual amount.
			- However, the problem is that the expenses incurred in FOH are often delayed, or its actual expenses cannot be reasonably provided in time. Hence, the normal costing system was developed.
			- [ ] Further research: why was the *normal costing system* developed
		- Normal Costing System → DM and DL are recorded in actual amount. FOH is in applied amount.

		- Manufacturing Overhead
			- Actual Manufacturing Overhead → costs actually incurred in the factory
				- ![[Pasted image 20240425090307.png]]
			- Applied Manufacturing Overhead → predetermined overhead rate, formula is as follow:
				- ![[Pasted image 20240425090518.png]]
				- ![[Pasted image 20240425090558.png]]
				- Manufacturing Overhead Account
					- Actual FOH → debit
					- Applied FOH → creidt
					- Net balance:
						- If actual FOH > applied FOH, then it is an *underapplied* overhead, thus, an *unfavourable* variance
						- If actual FOH < applied FOH, then it is an *overapplied* overhead, thus, a *favourable* variance
						- Disposition of overhead variance
							- If insignificant, then close the variance to Cost of Goods Sold
							- If significant, close the variance among the ending balances of the following:
								- WIP
								- FG
								- CGS
								- Use ratio
						- Breakdown of Overhead Variance
							- Spending Variance
							- Capacity Variance

	- Scrap Materials
		- **unavoidable** during production
		- It refers to filings or excessive trimmings of materials
		- Defective materials that cannot be returned to vendor or not suitable for manufacturing operations; or
		- Broken parts as a result of an employee error or machine breakdowns that causes the product in a poor-quality condition.
		- Scrap Sales may be accounted for as follows:
			- Additional revenue (if immaterial)
			- Reduction of cost of goods sold
			- **If silent, then: Reduction of factory overhead control**
			- Reduction in the Cost of Materials traceable to the particular job
			- ![[Pasted image 20240425102232.png]]
		- Spoiled Goods
			- Either partially or fully completed units, for reason of being spoiled, cannot be corrected because it is **not technically possible** to correct them, or it is not economical to correct them. Hence, no longer part of good units.
			- Spoilage may either be:
				- Charged to Particular Job - due to exacting specifications or customer-imposed standards
				- Charged to All Production / Factory Overhead - due to internal failure brought about by an employee error or worn-out machinery.
			- ![[Pasted image 20240425102709.png]]
		- Defective Goods
			- The process of correcting defective units in order to bring them into sale-able condition. Additional rework costs will be incurred. Reworked units are still part of good units.
			- If fault of customer, debit to WIP
			- If fault of our own, charged to FOH

- AFAR 02: Process Costing
	- Definition of Process Costing
		- This method is used when products are manufactured under the condition of continuous processing or mass production methods where the products manufactured within a department (cost centre) are *homogeneous* (or similar products) with equal amounts of materials, labour, and overhead applied to such products.
		- These conditions often exist in industries that produce homogeneous products or commodities such as paper, lumber, pipe petroleum, textiles, steel, wire, bricks, cement, flour, sugar, peanut butter, meat, sugar, cereals, linoleum, leather, nylon, tires and tubes, glass, mining, and canneries
		- The cost accumulation of materials, labour, and overhead must be by department or cost centre.
		- The cost assigned to each unit is determined by dividing the total cost charged to the cost centre by the number of units produced.
	- Two Process Costing-Related Reports
		- Production Report - shows the number of units that:
			- Were in process in the department at the start of the month;
			- The number of units transferred out of the department during the month;
			- The number of units still in work in process at the end of the month; and
			- The percentage of completion of the units still in process at the end of the month.
		- Cost of Production Report
