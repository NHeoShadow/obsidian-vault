- Preliminaries
- Basic Concepts on Wills and Succession
	- Kinds of Transfers
		- Onerous/Bilateral - give up something to receive another
			- Example: contract of sale
		- Gratuitous/unilateral - donation and succession
			- inter vivos - donation
			- mortis causa - succession
		- Complex transfers
			- Not all transfers are subject to tax. Only donation and estate tax are subject to tax.
	- Definition
		- Succession is a mode of acquisition by virtue of which the property, rights and obligations to the extend of the value of the inheritance, of a person are transmitted through his death to another or others either by his will or by operation of law.
			- A774, RA386
		- Estate characteristics: property, rights, and obligations
		- The rights to the succession are transmitted *from the moment of the death of the decedent*.
			- A777, RA386
		- 
- Estate Tax
	- Elements of Succession
		- Decedent - the dead one; otherwise known as Testator
		- Estate - ipapamana
		- Transferees - heirs, legatees, and devisees
			- A782, RA386: Heirs succeed by *universal title*. Those who are called to the whole or aliquot portion of the inheritance
				- Universal title - portion of estate, whatever the inheritance may be, no specific or determinate thing
			- Legatees succeed by particular title on personal properties
				- There are personal properties involved
			- Devisees succeed on real properties
	- Three Kinds of Succession
		- Intestate succession - walang iniwan na Last Will; operation of law dictates
		- Testamentary or Testate Succession - may iniwan na Last Will
		- Mixed Succession
	- Settlement (or process) of Estate
		- Probate of Will → Last Will is presented before the lower courts to verify the authenticity of the last will
		- Appointment of Administrator or confirmation of executor
			- Administrator takes care of the properties of the Decedent
		- Determination of Heirs, Legatees, and Devisees
		- Collation of estate of the decedent
		- Settlement of claims of creditors
		- If may matira: partition and distribution of the estate
	- Characteristics of Estate Tax
		- National Tax → imposed by the National Government
		- Proportional Tax → uniform tax rate (6%)
		- Ad valorem Tax → based on the value of the properties left by the decedent
		- Privilege/Transactional Tax
		- Direct Tax; no tax shifting occurs
	- Estate Tax Rate
		- 6%
		- Base: Net Taxable Estate

	- Basic Principles
		- Estate tax is **NOT** a tax on death
		- Estate tax is a tax on succession from the decedents to the transferees
		- Estate tax is **NOT** a tax on properties. Tax on properties is property tax
		- Estate tax is different from inheritance tax
		- Estate taxation is governed by the statute in force **at the time of death** of the decedent.
			- RR No. 12-2018, Section 3
		- Latest amendment on estate tax: January 2018
		- For CPALE, do not study the old law
