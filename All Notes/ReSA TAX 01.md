- Preliminaries
- Basic Concepts on Wills and Succession
	- Kinds of Transfers
		- Onerous/Bilateral - give up something to receive another
			- Example: contract of sale
		- Gratuitous/unilateral - donation and succession
			- inter vivos - donation
			- mortis causa - succession
		- Complex transfers
			- Not all transfers are subject to tax. Only donation and estate tax are subject to tax.
	- Definition
		- Succession is a mode of acquisition by virtue of which the property, rights and obligations to the extend of the value of the inheritance, of a person are transmitted through his death to another or others either by his will or by operation of law.
			- A774, RA386
		- Estate characteristics: property, rights, and obligations
		- The rights to the succession are transmitted *from the moment of the death of the decedent*.
			- A777, RA386
		- 
- Estate Tax
	- Elements of Succession
		- Decedent - the dead one; otherwise known as Testator
		- Estate - ipapamana
		- Transferees - heirs, legatees, and devisees
			- A782, RA386: Heirs succeed by *universal title*. Those who are called to the whole or aliquot portion of the inheritance
				- Universal title - portion of estate, whatever the inheritance may be, no specific or determinate thing
			- Legatees succeed by particular title on personal properties
				- There are personal properties involved
			- Devisees succeed on real properties
	- Three Kinds of Succession
		- Intestate succession - walang iniwan na Last Will; operation of law dictates
		- Testamentary or Testate Succession - may iniwan na Last Will
		- Mixed Succession
	- Settlement (or process) of Estate
		- Probate of Will → Last Will is presented before the lower courts to verify the authenticity of the last will
		- Appointment of Administrator or confirmation of executor
			- Administrator takes care of the properties of the Decedent
		- Determination of Heirs, Legatees, and Devisees
		- Collation of estate of the decedent
		- Settlement of claims of creditors
		- If may matira: partition and distribution of the estate
	- Characteristics of Estate Tax
		- National Tax → imposed by the National Government
		- Proportional Tax → uniform tax rate (6%)
		- Ad valorem Tax → based on the value of the properties left by the decedent
		- Privilege/Transactional Tax
		- Direct Tax; no tax shifting occurs
	- Estate Tax Rate
		- 6%
		- Base: Net Taxable Estate
		- Effectivity: January 2018
	- Basic Principles
		- Estate tax is **NOT** a tax on death
		- Estate tax is a tax on succession from the decedents to the transferees
		- Estate tax is **NOT** a tax on properties. Tax on properties is property tax
		- Estate tax is different from inheritance tax
		- Estate taxation is governed by the statute in force **at the time of death** of the decedent.
			- RR No. 12-2018, Section 3
		- Latest amendment on estate tax: January 2018
		- For CPALE, do not study the old law
		- Upon the death of the decedent, the right of the *State* to tax the privilege to transmit the estate vests instantly upon death.
			- Re: A777, RA 386
	- Gross Estate
		- Composition of Gross Estate
			- Real or personal
			- Tangible or intangible
			- Owned by the decedent
			- At the time of this death
		- Gross Estate per Taxpayer (situs rule)
			- See Table 1
			- Also see Table 2
		- 
- Reciprocity Rule
	- No tax shall be collected in respect of **intangible personal property (IPP**) if the decedent at the time of his death was a citizen and resident of a foreign country which at the time of his death did not impose a transfer tax or allows an exemption in respect of IPP of citizens of PH not residing in that foreign country.
		- NIRC, Section 104
	- Intangible Properties (FIENDS):
		- Franchise which must be exercised in PH
		- Shares or Rights in any partnership, business or industry established in the PH
		- Shares, obligations, and bonds (SOB) by any foreign corporation 85% of the business of which is not located abroad
		- SOB issued by any corporation or *sociedad anonima* organized or constituted in the PH
		- SOB issued by any foreign corporation if such SOB have acquired a business situs in PH.
		- Cash is an intangible personal property (HUH?)
			- Because it is only an obligation or right to acquire an item of equal value;
			- It is a contract promulgated by BSP or something
		- See Table 2
	- Valuation of Gross Estate
		- The properties comprising the gross estate shall be valued according to their **FAIR MARKET VALUE** as of the **TIME OF DECEDENT’S DEATH**
		- Fair Market Value Rules
			- Real Property: Zonal Value (Section 88B, NIRC)
			- Personal Properties
				- Recently Purchased: item price
				- Not-recently purchased: 3x pawn value
			- Unlisted common shares – book value based on latest AFS
			- Preference shares: Par value
	- Inclusions in Gross Estate
		- Are items not in the possession of the decedent at the time of his death included in the gross estate?
			- General rule: No

				- Retirement Proceeds under RA 4917 (NIRC, Section 85(C))
				- Transfers for Insufficient Consideration (NIRC, Section 85(G))
				- Proceeds of Life Insurance (NIRC, Section 85(E))

					- Presumption under Insurance Code
						- The insured shall have the right to change the beneficiary he designated in the policy, unless he has expressly waived this right in said policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the insured does not change the beneficiary during his lifetime, the designation shall be deemed irrevocable.
						- If the problem is silent, then deemed irrevocable
				- Transfers in contemplation of death (NIRC, Section 85(B))
