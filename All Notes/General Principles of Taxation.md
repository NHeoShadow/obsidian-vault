**Taxation** is the process or means by which the sovereign, through its law making body, imposes burdens upon subjects and objects within its jurisdiction for the purpose of raising revenues to carryout the legitimate objects of government.

It is the act of levying a tax to apportion the cost of government among those who, in some measure, are privileged to enjoy its benefits and must therefore bear its burdens.

### Aspects of Taxation
The power of the government to exercise its inherent power to tax is exercised both by the legislative and executive organs of the Philippine Government.

There are three aspects to taxation, namely:
1. *Levying*, or the imposition of tax, is a legislative function in which the national or local government imposes national or local tax to the people respectively. There is no limit to the amount of tax to be levied against persons, but can be limited through pieces of legislation enacted by the government.
2. *Assessment*, which is an executory function of the Philippine Government that determines the correct amount of tax due based on existing laws.
3. *Collection*, which is also an executory function of the Philippine Government to collect the amount of tax due where it is due.
