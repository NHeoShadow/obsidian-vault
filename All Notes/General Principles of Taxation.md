**Taxation** is the process or means by which the sovereign, through its law making body, imposes burdens upon subjects and objects within its jurisdiction for the purpose of raising revenues to carryout the legitimate objects of government.

### Aspects of Taxation
There are three aspects to taxation, namely:
1. *Levying*, or the imposition of tax, is a legislative function in which the national or local government imposes national or local tax to the people respectively.
2. *Assessment*, which is an executory function of the Philippine Government that determines the correct amount of tax due based on existing laws.
3. *Collection*, which is also an executory function of the Philippine Government to collect the amount of tax due where it is due.
