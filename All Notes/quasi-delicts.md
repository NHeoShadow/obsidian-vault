Quasi-delicts refers to acts or omissions from someone that causes damage to another as a result of fault or negligence. Quasi-delicts arise if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the two parties involved.

They are governed by the provisions of Title XVII Chapter 2 of the Civil Code.

Damages caused by a minor children of a family will cause the father to be responsible for damages, or in his death or incapacity, the mother.

If a minor or insane person has no father, mother, or guardian, the minor or insane person shall be answerable with his own property in an action against him where a *guardian ad litem* shall be appointed.

> A guardian ad litem is a person appointed by a court to look after and protect the interests of someone who is unable to take care of themselves.

The responsibility of two or more persons who are liable for quasi-delict is solidary.
