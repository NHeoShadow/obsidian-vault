**Taxation** is the process or means by which the sovereign, through its law making body, imposes burdens upon subjects and objects within its jurisdiction for the purpose of raising revenues to carryout the legitimate objects of government.

It is the act of levying a tax to apportion the cost of government among those who, in some measure, are privileged to enjoy its benefits and must therefore bear its burdens.

### Aspects of Taxation
The power of the government to exercise its inherent power to tax is exercised both by the legislative and executive organs of the Philippine Government.

There are three aspects to taxation, namely:
1. *Levying*, or the imposition of tax, is a legislative function in which the national or local government imposes national or local tax to the people respectively. There is no limit to the amount of tax to be levied against persons, but can be limited through pieces of legislation enacted by the government.
2. *Assessment*, which is an executory function of the Philippine Government that determines the correct amount of tax due based on existing laws.
3. *Collection*, which is also an executory function of the Philippine Government to collect the amount of tax due where it is due.

> The Congress is responsible for the levying of tax at the national level, while the Sanggunian (or Legislative Board) of the respective local government units is responsible for the levying of tax at the local level.

> [!note]- Executory Function
> Note that in executing laws, all issuances, rules and regulations promulgated by the appropriate agencies of the Philippine Government **shall** conform to the provisions of such law. Any deviations from it shall be held illegal or invalid.

#### The Tax Code
The tax code responsible for the levying of taxes at the national level is the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), enacted as RA8424. The following are the subjects and objects of taxation: (1) persons, either natural or juridical; (2) properties; (3) privileges or rights; and (4) transactions or interests.

Note that the NIRC follows a progressive tax system, meaning that the tax imposed on an individual is proportionate to their wealth.

### Purpose of Taxation
The primary purposes of taxation on the part of the government is to **provide fund or property** with which to **promote the general welfare and the protection of its citizens** and to enable it to finance its multifarious activities.

> The maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and the promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy. —Article II Section 5 of The 1987 Philippine Constitution.

Taxation is also employed as a devise for regulation or control by means of which certain effects or conditions envisioned by the government may be achieved such as the promotion of general welfare, the reduction of social inequality, and economic growth.
### Theory and Basis of Taxation
The **Lifeblood Doctrine**, which presupposes that the government cannot exist nor endure without tax. Consequently, the state has the right to compel all its citizens and property within its limits to contribute. Also, the **Necessity Theory** which states that tax is a power emanating from necessity of the people.

> [!note]- On Lifeblood Doctrine…
> Taxes are the lifeblood of the government. Thus, it should be collected without unnecessary delay. Its collection, however, should not be tainted with arbitrariness.

> [!quote]- On Necessity Theory…
> It is a power emanating from necessity. It is a necessary burden to preserve the state’s sovereignty and a means to give the citizenry an army to resist an aggression, a navy to defend its shores from invasion, a corps of civil servants to serve, public improvements designed for the enjoyment of the citizenry and those which come within the state’s territory, and facilities and protection which a government is supposed to provide. (Phil. Guarantee Co., Inc. vs. CIR, 13 SCRA 775)

The **Benefits Received Theory**, also known as the *Reciprocity Theory*, which provides for a basis for collection of taxes so that it can provide services essential for the upkeep of the nation with its citizens. Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society (read: Commissioner v. Algue). This theory also spawned the *Doctrine of Symbiotic Relationship*.
