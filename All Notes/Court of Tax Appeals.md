The Court of Tax Appeals is an appellate court settling controversies regarding the assessment or collection of tax from persons and entities, both natural and juridical alike.

Only the Court of Tax Appeals, through administrative remedies when collection could jeopardize the interest of the government or taxpayer, shall have the authority to grant an injunction to restrain the collection of any national internal revenue tax, fee, or charge imposed by the [[Fundamental Principles of Taxation#The Tax Code|National Internal Revenue Code]]
