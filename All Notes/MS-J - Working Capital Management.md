### Economic Order Quantity & Reorder Point
**Economic Order Quantity**, or *EOQ*, refers to the optimal number of units to purchase for a unit taking into account all relevant costs related to purchasing. At EOQ level, the total costs will be at the lowest possible amount.

There are two (2) costs primarily associated in purchasing units, namely:
- *Ordering Costs*, which refers to the costs related to making an order; and
- *Carrying Costs*, which refers to the costs related to storing a unit.

The formula for EQO is as follow:

$$ EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DO}{C}} $$
whereas:
- $D$ refers to annual demand or usage in units;
- $O$ refers to costs of placing one order; and
- $C$ refers to cost of carrying one unit for one year.

To find for the amounts for carrying and ordering costs, the formula below may be of use:

| Item Particular           | Formula   |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| Average Inventory Units   | (EOC /2)  |
| Carrying Costs            | (EOC /2)C |
| Number of Orders per year | (D /EOQ)  |
| Ordering Costs            | (D /EOQ)O |

Meanwhile, the **reorder point** provides for the level by which a business entity makes an order to ensure that little to no stockout costs is incurred based on the delivery time of the supplier to the entity, all while taking into account extra carrying costs that may be incurred.

- *Stockout Costs* refer to opportunity costs forfeited as a result of the entity being unable to conduct sales as a result of no inventory.

In solving for the reorder point^[1], the average and maximum *lead time* must be taken into account.

$$ RP = (l_x * d_a) s $$
whereas:
- $l_x$ refers to the average or normal lead time;
- $d_a$ refers to the average daily demand; and
- $s$ refers to safety stock.

The safety stock level can be solved using this formula:

$$ s = (l_m - l_x)d_a $$
whereas:
- $l_m$ refers to the average or normal lead time;
- $l_x$ refers to the maximum lead time; and
- $d_a$ refers to the average daily demand.

> The EOQ answers *how many units to order?*, while the re-order point answers *when to make the order?*



[1]: Alternatively, the following formula can also be used to compute for the reorder point: $RP = (l_m * d_a)$;whereas: $l_m$ refers to the maximum lead time; and $d_a$ refers to the average daily demand
