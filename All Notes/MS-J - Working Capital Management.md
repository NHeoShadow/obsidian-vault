### Economic Order Quantity
Economic Order Quantity, or *EOQ*, refers to the optimal number of units to purchase for a unit taking into account all relevant costs related to purchasing. At EOQ level, the total costs will be at the lowest possible amount.

There are two (2) costs primarily associated in purchasing units, namely:
- *Ordering Costs*, which refers to the costs related to making an order; and
- *Carrying Costs*, which refers to the costs related to storing a unit.

The formula for EQO is as follow:

$$ EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DO}{C}} $$
whereas:
- $D$ refers to annual demand or usage in units;
- $O$ refers to costs of placing one order; and
- $C$ refers to cost of carrying one unit for one year.
