In the current setup of the Philippine Constitution, laws are created either by the bicameral legislature organ called the Congress, or by issuances made by the President of the Philippine Republic.

## The President
The President shall have the authority to issue Executive Orders which shall affect the execution of constitutional or statutory powers.

Presidential Decrees, which were issuances made by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, are laws which vested the Chief Executive the law-making powers of the Congress during Martial Law. All Presidential Decrees are still valid up until this date, unless otherwise repealed, amended, or modified accordingly by a law.

## The Congress
The Congress is composed of two House of Congress, or *Chambers*, namely the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each House of Congress follows a set or rules that provides for the policies in making legislations.

Before a law is created, it is first introduced as a Bill in either House of Congress- a Senate Bill for the Senate, and a House Bill for the House of Representatives. However, in some cases, especially for urgent issues requiring immediate attention, Bills are introduced in both House of Congress concurrently as separate Bills.

Bills are then referred to a committee in a House of Congress to deliberate, inquire, and investigate the provisions contained therein. Then, the committee may either recommend for the approval of such Bill after due consideration by them, or rejected.

A Bill must be read three times in each House of Congress before they can pass the same (unless it is certified by the President as urgent). Then, it is signed by the President for it to become law.

Actually, there are three ways by which a Bill becomes a law after it has been previously approved by both House of Congress, and are as follow:

1. If the President signs it;
2. If the President does not sign it, but communicates his veto to the House of Congress where such bill has originated within a period of thirty (30) days, then each House of Congress, voting separately, passes the bill with two-thirds supermajority taking into account the veto of the President; or
3. If the President does not sign it and does not communicate his veto within thirty (30) days.
