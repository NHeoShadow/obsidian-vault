## Introduction to Management Accounting

Management accounting refers to the use of *accounting information* by company management to make rational economic decisions in performing its function of planning, organizing, and controlling business operations. It is forward looking.

Meanwhile, financial accounting deals with the reporting of past economic events of the business entity. Both management and financial accounting use the same accounting data to report the status of the entity or make decisions for the company's venture.
