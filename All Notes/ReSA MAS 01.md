		- ...
	- **Topic Proper**
		- Management Accounting:: the use of accounting information by company management to make rational economic *decisions* in performing its function of *planning*, *organizing*, and *controlling* business operations
			- In planning, organizing, and controlling, an objective basis is required in order to make decisions.
		- Management accounting presents information differently compared to financial accounting.
			- Example: Financial accounting presents income statement in function form, while management accounting presents income statement by behaviour
			- Both draw from *the same* accounting database
			- Cost accounting is a subset of both management and financial accounting
				- ![[Pasted image 20240422094241.png]]
		- Management accounting is *future oriented*
		- *Three Management Functions*, in this same exact order:
			- Planning - deciding on company goals and objectives and figures out how to achieve them.
				- If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
				- Associated terms: road mapping, goal setting
			- Organizing - deciding on how to use company resources to put plans into action.
				- Associated terms: directing and motivating; staffing and subordinating
			- Controlling - deciding on what corrective actions to do should there be any difference between actual results and planned results
				- Associated terms: monitoring; feedback mechanism
			- Decision-making is an inherent function of management as ==**all**== management functions would require a certain level of decision-making; this makes management accounting information useful in all stages of management.
		- Goal of Financial Management - modern managerial finance theory works under the premise that the primary goal of the firm is to maximize *==shareholders' wealth==*, rather than just to maximize profit. The financial manager acts in the shareholders' best interests by making decisions that maximize the *market value* of the company stocks (i.e., wealth creation)
		- Role of Financial Managers - the role of a financial manager may include *financial analysis and planning*, *investment decisions*, *financing and capital structure decisions*, *management of financial resources*, and *risk amnagement*. No single person is tasked for all the responsibilities of a financial manager.
- **MS-4702: Quantitative Techniques**
	- **Economic Order Quantity**
		- Inventory Models
			- How many units to order
				- Factors needed to take into account:
					- Ordering Costs (OC)
						- The more units to order, the less ordering costs a company may incur
					- Carrying Costs (CC)
						- Need to take into account expiration/spoil date of the inventory at hand
					- A balance between ordering costs and carrying costs must be taken into account. Hence, **EOQ**
						- The quantity you should order in order to optimize the ordering and carrying costs incurred.
						- 
			- When to make the order
	- **Learning Curve**
