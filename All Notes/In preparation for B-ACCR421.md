The Integrated Review (course-code: `B-ACCR421`) will be a two-week-long review of all the lessons covered under the BS Accountancy program that will be covered in the CPALE. Schedules will be divided into two groups for AM and PM sessions, with each group having 80 students each.

Given the limited time of the Integrated Review course for our program (some HEIs actually allocate one semester for a CPA review course) and to increase the likelihood that I pass the course, I started to recall and review all the topics for the CPALE last December 26, 2023. This early start will (hopefully) give me an advantage to review most topics before the final defence and OJT period for the program.

Since the company that I will be working during the OJT period will have a hybrid setup for work (3 days online; 2 days onsite), I am also planning to utilize this to my advantage to dedicate 4 days of my week in reviewing CPALE subjects with emphasis for one subject at a time.

My usual study habit include 2 consecutive Pomodoro sessions at any given time. A 45-minute focus time, followed by a 15-minute short break, then another 45-minute focus time, followed by a 30-minute long break.

I am also planning to utilize [YPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ypt-yeolpumta/id1441909643) and invite friends who are also interested to participate in keeping track of their study habit. Another technique that I plan to utilize is spaced repetition, which Obsidian provides via a [community plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition).

Ultimately, one main factor that determines if someone passes the board or not is how effective they utilize their free time, their commitment of attaining a CPA title, and their discipline throughout the journey.
