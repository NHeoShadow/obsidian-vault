- Covers *1.4.1* in CPALE syllabus
- **Relevant Costing**
	- otherwise known as *short-term decision-making*.
		- If long-term decision-making, then it is considered as *Capital Budgeting*
	- Choosing from *at least* two (2) alternatives
	- The objective in making a decision is to ==maximize profit==
		- Our goal is not to make profit, but to **MAXIMIZE** profit; minimize cost and maximize revenue
	- 
	- **Relevant Costs** are:
		- costs that shall be incurred in the **future**; **and**
			- Costs that were already incurred are *sunk costs*
		- costs should be different between the alternatives.
	- *Variable Costs* are relevant costs.
	- Sub-categories:
		- Make or Buy
			- Whether to make the product within the company or buy from external sources.
			- Criteria: lowest cost is the preferred decision.
			- Fixed Factory Overhead Costs will still be incurred if the decision is to buy, unless the problem provides for otherwise.
			- Opportunity Costs is a *relevant cost*
			- The maximum amount that a company is willing to pay an outside supplier is the maximum purchase price
			- Also take into account the quality of the product that is being bought (in reality).
		- Accept or Reject
		- Continue or Shutdown
			- Common fixed expenses are irrelevant costs; it is allocated on a per-branch basis.
			- ![[Pasted image 20240424100320.png]]
			- If units produced is greater than shutdown point, then continue.
			- If units produced is less than shutdown point, then shutdown.
			- If units produced is equal to shutdown point, either continue or shutdown (indifference).
			- ==Shutdown Point -> Indifference Point==
			- Segment Margin = Contribution Margin - Traceable Fixed Costs
		- Sell or Process Further
			- *Joint Costs* 
			- There is no point of selling a product with 0 profit value. 
		- Best Product Combination
	- **Total Analysis vs Differential Costs** (review recording if ever)
		- Using Total Analysis, the profit is computed using the income statement in a whole approach.
		- Using Differential Analysis, only the increase based on the contribution margin is analysed.
		- ==Differential Analysis is the preferred method.==
	- **Special Order Pricing**
		- @full capacity, minimum selling price is unit selling price
		- @excess capacity, minimum selling price is unit variable cost
