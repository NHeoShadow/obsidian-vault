- Covers *1.4.1* in CPALE syllabus
- **Relevant Costing**
	- otherwise known as *short-term decision-making*.
		- If long-term decision-making, then it is considered as *Capital Budgeting*
	- Choosing from *at least* two (2) alternatives
	- The objective in making a decision is to ==maximize profit==
		- Our goal is not to make profit, but to **MAXIMIZE** profit; minimize cost and maximize revenue
	- **Relevant Costs** are:
		- costs that shall be incurred in the **future**; **and**
			- Costs that were already incurred are *sunk costs*
		- costs should be different between the alternatives.
	- *Variable Costs* are relevant costs.
	- Sub-categories:
		- Make or Buy
		- Accept or Reject
		- Continue or Shutdown
		- Sell or Process Further
		- Best Product Combination
	- **Total Analysis vs Differential Costs**
		- Using Total Analysis, the profit is computed using the income statement in a whole approach.
		- Using Differential Analysis, only the increase based on the contribution margin is analysed.
