The three inherent powers of the State refers to the powers granted to the state regardless if it is expressly stated in its charter/constitution or not. These powers, being inherent to the State, is given to the State as soon as it is established.

There are three inherent powers of the State, namely:
- The **[[General Principles of Taxation|power of taxation]]**, which refers to the power of the state to raise revenue to defray the necessary expenditures of the government. 
- The **police power**, which aims to promote public welfare by restraining and promulgating the use of liberty and property.
- The **power of eminent domain**, which refers to the power of the State to acquire private property for public purpose upon payment of just compensation, oftentimes measured at *fair market value*.
