- **Law on Sales**
	- Definition
		- By the contract of sale one of the contracting parties obligates himself to transfer the ownership and to deliver a determinate thing, and the other to pay thereof a price certain in money or its equivalent. (Art 1458)
		- Governed by Title VI “SALES” of RA386
	- Characteristics of a Contract of Sale:
		- Purpose: of the delivery is to transfer of ownership;
		- Perfection: as a rule, is by mere consent, since there exists a contract of sale the moment the parties “obligate” themselves.
		- Subject matter: determinate thing
		- Cause: onerous, since the cause or consideration of the parties is the prestation or promise of the other
		- Bilateral contract: since both parties have their respective obligations
		- Nominate contract: not only because there’s a specific designation of the contract, but more so because there are specific rules provided by law to govern the rights and obligations of the parties, after stipulations;
		- Commutative: in the same sense that there is equivalence in the prestation of the parties. ordinarily, price reflects the value of the property, since the seller would not normally accept a price below the value of the property and the buyer would not normally pay an amount more than the value of the property.
			- If not, then it is possible that it is 
		- Aleatory: there is also a sale of hope where there is no equivalence in the value of prestation. Since the obligation of the other party is not certain to arise (Art 1461)
