- Definition, Aspects, and Purposes
	- Definition
		- Taxation is the process or means by which the sovereign, through its law making body, imposes burdens upon subjects and objects within its jurisdiction for the purpose of raising revenues to carry out the legitimate objects of government.
			- In the Philippines, the Congress is the legislature organ of the country as created by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. It is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
			- Subjects and objects of taxation
				- Persons, either natural (individuals) or juridical (created by operation of law)
				- Properties
				- Privileges or Rights
				- Transactions or Interests
		- In simple terms, it is the act of levying a tax to apportion the cost of government among those who, in some measure, are privileged to enjoy its benefits and must therefore bear its burdens.
			- The National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (RA 8424) is the basis for taxation law. Subsequent amendments were made in the NIRC based on the following Republic Acts:
				- RA 10963 (TRAIN Law)
				- RA 11256
				- RA 11346
				- RA 11467
				- RA 11534
			- 
	- Aspects
		- Process of tax is as follow:
			- Levying (or Imposition of Tax, or Enactment of Tax Law)
				- Through the Congress, this is a ==Legislative Function==, especially on the enactment of national tax
				- For local tax, the legislative organ (i.e., mga Sanggunian) of the local government units is responsible in the imposition of tax
			- Assessment
				- Executive Function
				- Determines the correct amount of tax due based on existing laws
				- National Government: Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs
				- Local Government: City Treasurers, Provincial Treasurers, Barangay Treasurers
			- Collection (Executive Function as well)
				- Bureau of Internal Revenue
			- Other Note: Functions of Three Branches:
				- Executive - executes law
				- Legislative - creates law
				- Judiciary - settles disputes
					- Supreme Court - Highest Judiciary
					- Court of Tax Appeals - special court
					- Note: Civil Code, Jurisprudence
			- The power of the government to exercise taxation is exercised both the legislative and executive organs of the Philippine government.
	- Purposes
		- Primary purpose: revenue/fiscal
			- The primary purpose of taxation on the part of the government is to provide funds or property with which to promote the general welfare and the protection of its citizens and to enable it to finance its multifarious activities.
		- Secondary Purpose: regulatory (sumptuary/compensatory)
			- Taxation is often employed as a devise for regulation or control (i.e., implementation of State’s police power) by means of which certain effects or conditions envisioned by the government may be achieved such as:
				- Promotion of General Welfare
					- ex.: sin tax law
					- “The power to tax involves the power to destroy”
						- [McCulloch v Maryland (1819)](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/mcculloch-v-maryland)
				- Reduction of Social Inequality
					- Progressive Taxation Scheme; the richer you are, the higher your taxes are
				- Economic Growth
					- Taxes imposed in Philippine Exclusive Economic Zones (PEZZ) are lower to promote economic growth.
- The 3 Inherent Powers of the State
	- Refers to the power of the state that is inherent in a state regardless if such provision is given in the Constitution and its laws or not.
	- Basically, these powers are essential/fundamental as soon as a state is established.
	- **Power to tax** → power by which the state raises revenue to defray the necessary expenses of the government.
	- **Police power** → power of the state for promoting public welfare by restraining and promulgating the use of liberty and property.
	- **Power of eminent domain** → power of the State to acquire private property for public purpose upon payment of just compensation.
	- Similar characteristics of the three inherent powers:
		- They are inherent in the state
		- They exist independently of the Constitution although the conditions for their exercise may be prescribed by the Constitution. 
		- Ways by which the State interfere with private rights and property
		- Legislative in nature and character
		- Presuppose an equivalent compensation received, directly or indirectly, by the persons affected
	- Distinction of the three (3) inherent powers (see Table 1)
		- The power to tax is the most supreme among the three inherent powers of a state because tax is the lifeblood of a state. Without tax, a government cannot exist.
		- There is no limit to the amount of tax to be levied against persons. (But still, subject to the NIRC and local taxation laws; still limited to the capabilities of the taxpayer.)
- Theory and Basis of Taxation
	- Theory of Taxation (Why?)
		- Lifeblood Doctrine
			- Without taxes, the government would be paralyzed for lack of the motive power to activate and operate it.
			- Justification for imposition of tax
				- The government, for its part, is expected to respond in the form of tangible and intangible benefits intended to improve the lives of the people and enhance their moral and material values (Commissioner vs Algue)
			- The power of taxation is essential because the government can neither exist nor endure without taxation.
			- Taxes are the lifeblood of the government and their prompt and certain availability is an imperious need.
			- The government cannot continue to perform its basic functions of serving and protecting its people without means to pay its expenses.
			- ==Consequently, the state has the right to compel all its citizens and property within its limits to contribute.==
			- Tax is an **enforced contribution**.
		- Necessity Theory
			- It is a power emanating from necessity. It is a necessary burden to preserve the state’s sovereignty and a means to give the citizenry an army to resist an aggression, a navy to defend its shores from invasion, a corps of civil servants to serve, public improvements designed for the enjoyment of the citizenry and those which come within the state’s territory, and facilities and protection which a government is supposed to provide. (Phil. Guarantee Co., Inc. vs. CIR, 13 SCRA 775)
	- Basis of Taxation (Rationale)
		- Benefits Received or Reciprocity Theory
			- The basis is the reciprocal duties of protection and support between the state and its inhabitants. The state collects taxes from the subjects of taxation in order that it may be able to perform the functions of government. The citizens, on the other hand, pay taxes in order that they may be secured in the enjoyment of the benefits of organised society. This theory spawned the *Doctrine of Symbiotic Relationship* which means, taxes are what we pay for a civilized society (Commissioner v. Algue).
