### Learning Curve
**Learning Curve**, also known as *experience curve*, *productivity curve*, or *efficiency curve*, is a phenomenon wherein labour time decreases in a ==definite pattern== as labour operations are repeated.

It also describes the *efficiencies* arising from *experience* - with experience comes increased productivity. The time required to perform a given task becomes progressively shorter (only applicable to early stages of production).

The learning curve is based on statistical findings that as the cumulative output doubles, the cumulative average labour input time required per unit will decrease by some percentage.

> [!note] 
> The percentage for learning curve is the inverse of the rate of reduction. Meaning, if there is an 80% learning curve, then the average rate of reduction decreases by 20%.

Use the following format below:

| Unit | Average | Total |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 4    | 250     | 1000  |
|      |         |       |
