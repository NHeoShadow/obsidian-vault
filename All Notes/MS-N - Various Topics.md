### Learning Curve
**Learning Curve**, also known as *experience curve*, *productivity curve*, or *efficiency curve*, is a phenomenon wherein labour time decreases in a ==definite pattern== as labour operations are repeated.

It also describes the *efficiencies* arising from *experience* - with experience comes increased productivity. The time required to perform a given task becomes progressively shorter (only applicable to early stages of production).

The learning curve is based on statistical findings that as the cumulative output doubles, the cumulative average labour input time required per unit will decrease by some percentage.

> [!note] 
> The percentage for learning curve is the inverse of the rate of reduction. Meaning, if there is an 80% learning curve, then the average rate of reduction decreases by 20%.


Take note of the #example below: a 20% decrease overtime based on the amount of units produced:

| Unit | Average | Total |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 4    | 250     | 1000  |
| 8    | 200     | 1600  |
| 16   | 160     | 2560  |

To produce 4 units, a total of 1000 hours will be used. Producing 8 units, or producing another 4 units, will use another 600 hours. Lastly, producing 16 units, or an additional 8 units, will use another 960 hours. 

Observe that the average time to produce one unit decreases as the learning curve influences the total hours used to produce one unit.
