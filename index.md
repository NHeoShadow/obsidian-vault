Welcome to my digital garden. This website is a mirror of my notes located in my local Obsidian vault which is published to this site from time to time. 

This site focuses on topics covered for the Licensure Exam for Certified Public Accountants using ReSA's study guide. A review tracker created by me can be accessed using [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZYcrZEsSWFpGT7bwccuNtU_CFSy3FNb94MczraCj39I/edit?usp=sharing).
