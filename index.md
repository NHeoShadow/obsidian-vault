Hello, Iâ€™m Raph. This is my digital garden that contains all of my notes from my Obsidian vault, published and updated from time to time as I complete my review in preparation for the CPALE. 

This website focuses on the topics covered in the CPALE using ReSAâ€™s study guide as a main framework for categorizing different lessons and topics. A review tracker which I created from scratch can be accessed from this [Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZYcrZEsSWFpGT7bwccuNtU_CFSy3FNb94MczraCj39I/edit?usp=sharing).
