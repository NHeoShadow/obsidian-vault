Hello, I’m [@Raph](https://www.facebook.com/aciloraphael/). This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) which contains all my notes from my Obsidian vault, published and updated from time to time in line with my preparation for the CPALE.

This website focuses on topics covered in the CPALE using ReSA’s study guide as the main framework for categorizing the different lessons thereunder, as well as legislatures that I think would aide in the CPA profession especially to those thinking of pursuing a law-related profession. The contents of this website is my way of preparing myself for the Integrated review.

> [!quote]- Panunumpa ng Propesyonal
> Ako, si (pangalan) ay taimtim na nanunumpa na itataguyod ko at ipagtatanggol ang Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas, na ako ay tunay na mananalig at tatalima rito; na susundin ko ang mga batas, mga utos na legal, at mga atas na ipinahayag ng mga sadyang itinakdang may kapangyarihan ng Republika ng Pilipinas; at kusa kong babalikatin ang pananagutang ito, na walang ano mang pasubali o hangaring umiwas.

> Taimtim pa rin akong manunumpa na sa lahat ng panahon at pook na kinaroroonan ay mahigpit akong manghahawakan sa mga etikal at tuntuning propesyonal ng mga Certified Public Accountants sa Pilipinas, at marapat kong gagampanan ng buong husay sa abot ng aking makakaya ang mga tungkulin at pananagutang iniatang sa isang itinakdang Certfiied Public Accountant.
