Hello, Iâ€™m Raph. This is my digital garden that contains all of my notes from my Obsidian vault, published and updated from time to time as I complete my review in preparation for the CPALE. 

This website focuses on the topics covered in the CPALE using ReSAâ€™s study guide as a main framework for categorizing different lessons and topics. A review tracker which I created from scratch can be accessed from this [Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZYcrZEsSWFpGT7bwccuNtU_CFSy3FNb94MczraCj39I/edit?usp=sharing).

This website is best viewed using the [iA Writer Quattro V Regular](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master) font family.

## How to browse
To use this digital garden, it is highly recommended that you have gained mastery for a particular subject matter. The notes contained herein are more of a *recall* for all the lessons under the board exam.

## Contribute
Contributing to this vault is quite complex. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is utilized as the primary note-taking application, while GitHub is used to synchronize changes from the vault to the website.

If interested, feel free to send me a message thru Facebook Messenger.
